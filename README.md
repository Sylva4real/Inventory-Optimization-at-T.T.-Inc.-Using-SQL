# Data-Driven Strategies for Inventory Optimisation at T.T Inc.
Project Overview

This project focuses on optimising inventory management at T.T. Inc. using SQL (Progress SQL). By analyzing historical sales data, I identified inefficiencies in demand forecasting, stock levels, and product availability. The goal was to streamline inventory control, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.

Business Challenges:

Overstock & Understock: Inefficient inventory management leading to excess costs or missed sales.
Seasonal Demand Fluctuations: Lack of accurate demand forecasting affecting stock availability.
Product Availability Issues: Stock shortages causing customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue.

Project Objectives

✔ Optimise Inventory Levels – Reduce overstock and understock issues to minimize costs.
✔ Improve Demand Forecasting – Use historical data to predict seasonal sales trends.
✔ Enhance Customer Satisfaction – Ensure product availability to improve user experience.
✔ Increase Operational Efficiency – Streamline supply chain processes and reduce waste.
✔ Enable Data-Driven Decisions – Provide actionable insights for inventory management.
